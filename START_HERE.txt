SCENARIO 3: Code Exploration (If You Like Programming)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⏱️ Time needed: 4-6 hours

1. Run ode_fitting_tutorial.py, understand output

2. Modify the code:
   - Change initial parameters
   - Try different noise levels
   - Experiment with optimization methods
   - Add a third compartment
   - See how changes affect fit quality

3. Try to reproduce results with your own code

4. Study: What you broke and why
   - Much faster learning than just reading!

================================================================================

================================================================================
QUICK ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: "Do I need a pharmacology background?"
A: No. This package includes pharmacology fundamentals. Math & coding matter more.

Q: "How long should I spend preparing?"
A: Minimum 3 hours (run code + quick review). Ideal: 1 week of study.

Q: "Should I memorize everything?"
A: No. Understand concepts. Interviewers care about thinking, not facts.

Q: "What if I don't understand something?"
A: Expected! Ask the interviewer to clarify. Good response: "I'm not familiar 
   with that, but here's how I'd approach it..."

Q: "Will I need to code during the interview?"
A: Unlikely full code, but understand logic. Explain what code does.

Q: "Is Python the only language they use?"
A: No. They use NONMEM mainly. Python is complementary, shows you can learn.

Q: "What if they ask about NONMEM?"
A: Honest answer: "I haven't used NONMEM yet, but I understand the principles
   and I'm excited to learn it. Here's my experience with similar tools..."

Q: "How different is this from what they'll teach?"
A: This teaches fundamentals that transfer. NONMEM is more specialized. You're
   building a strong foundation, not learning their specific tool.

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE BUILDING
================================================================================

Remember:

✓ You were invited because you have potential
✓ They know you're an intern (you're not expected to be an expert)
✓ They want to see: strong fundamentals, curiosity, willingness to learn
✓ Mathematical thinking matters more than domain knowledge
✓ Honest answers >> guessed answers
✓ Asking questions shows engagement
✓ Enthusiasm is contagious

You got this. 🚀

================================================================================
FINAL TIPS
================================================================================

1. Practice explaining your code out loud
   - To a friend, family member, or record yourself
   - This is where interviews usually go wrong

2. Understand, don't memorize
   - If you understand residuals, you can explain them different ways

3. Be honest about limitations
   - "I don't know that" is better than making something up

4. Ask questions
   - "What does this parameter mean in your real models?" shows engagement

5. Show enthusiasm
   - You genuinely care about helping patients with math
   - This matters more than you think

6. Get sleep
   - Well-rested brain > tired brain

7. Breathe
   - They're not trying to trick you
   - They want you to succeed

================================================================================

Good luck! You have everything you need.
