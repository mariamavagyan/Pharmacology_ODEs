ODE FITTING FOR CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY INTERVIEW
======================================================================


1. ODE SYSTEMS FOR PHARMACOLOGY
   - Used to model drug concentrations, effects, and disease dynamics
   - Multi-compartment models: central, peripheral, effect compartments
   - Key parameters: absorption (k_a), distribution (V), elimination (k_e)

2. PARAMETER ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES
   - Optimization algorithms: least squares, maximum likelihood
   - Global optimization: differential evolution, genetic algorithms
   - Local optimization: Nelder-Mead, Powell
   - Weighted vs unweighted fitting

3. MODEL PERFORMANCE METRICS
   - RMSE: magnitude of prediction errors
   - R²: proportion of variance explained (0-1)
   - MAE: average absolute error
   - AIC/BIC: model comparison and complexity trade-off

4. DIAGNOSTIC PLOTS INDICATE:
   - Observed vs Predicted: how well model captures data
   - Residuals: systematic biases (should be random)
   - Q-Q plot: whether residuals are normally distributed
   - Homoscedasticity: constant variance of residuals

5. COMMON PK/PD MODELS
   - Linear Compartmental Models: simple, interpretable
   - Nonlinear PK: Michaelis-Menten elimination
   - Pharmacodynamic: Emax model, indirect response models
   - Time-to-event models: survival analysis

6. BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
   - First-pass metabolism
   - Protein binding effects
   - Active metabolites
   - Drug-drug interactions
   - Disease state effects on PK/PD

7. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
   - Use scipy.integrate.odeint() for ODE solving
   - scipy.optimize for parameter estimation
   - Always validate on independent data
   - Document assumptions and limitations

8. QUESTIONS TO ASK INTERVIEWER
   - What therapeutic areas do you focus on?
   - What are common challenges in your modeling projects?
   - How do you handle sparse sampling scenarios?
   - What tools/languages does your team use? (NONMEM, mrgsolve, etc.)
