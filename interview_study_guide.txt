================================================================================
1. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS
================================================================================


ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (ODEs)
───────────────────────────────────────
Definition: An equation involving derivatives of unknown functions.
General form: dy/dt = f(y, t)

Example (exponential decay - drug elimination):
  dC/dt = -k*C
  
  Solution: C(t) = C₀ * e^(-k*t)
  
  Interpretation:
  - C(t): concentration at time t
  - k: elimination rate constant
  - C₀: initial concentration

LINEAR VS NONLINEAR ODES
───────────────────────
Linear ODE: dC/dt = -k*C (solution can be computed analytically)
Nonlinear ODE: dC/dt = -C²/(V+C) (requires numerical methods)

SYSTEMS OF ODEs
────────────────
Multi-compartment models involve multiple coupled ODEs:

Example (2-compartment):
  dC_central/dt = -(k₁₂ + k_e)*C_central + k₂₁*C_peripheral
  dC_peripheral/dt = k₁₂*C_central - k₂₁*C_peripheral

Where:
  - k₁₂: transfer rate from central to peripheral
  - k₂₁: transfer rate from peripheral to central  
  - k_e: elimination rate from central compartment

KEY TERMS:
──────────
• Compartment: Hypothetical space where drug distributes homogeneously
• First-order kinetics: Elimination rate proportional to concentration (linear)
• Zero-order kinetics: Constant elimination rate regardless of concentration
• Bioavailability (F): Fraction of dose that reaches systemic circulation
• Volume of Distribution (V): Theoretical volume drug distributes into
• Half-life (t₁/₂): Time for concentration to drop to half: t₁/₂ = 0.693/k_e
• Clearance (CL): Volume of plasma cleared per unit time: CL = k_e * V
• Area Under Curve (AUC): Total drug exposure over time


================================================================================
2. PHARMACODYNAMICS CONCEPTS
================================================================================


PHARMACODYNAMICS (PD) - HOW DRUGS AFFECT THE BODY
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

Common PD Models:

1. EMAX MODEL (Most common)
   E = E_max * C / (EC₅₀ + C)
   
   Where:
   - E: effect (0 to E_max)
   - C: drug concentration
   - E_max: maximum effect
   - EC₅₀: concentration at 50% E_max
   
   Use: Dose-response relationships, tumor growth inhibition

2. INDIRECT RESPONSE MODEL
   dE/dt = k_in - k_out*E + (PD effect)*C
   
   Use: When drug doesn't directly affect biomarker but affects 
   production/elimination

3. TUMOR GROWTH INHIBITION (TGI)
   dT/dt = λ*T - k_kill*C*T
   
   Where:
   - T: tumor burden
   - λ: growth rate
   - k_kill: drug-induced killing rate
   - C: drug concentration

PHARMACOKINETIC-PHARMACODYNAMIC (PK/PD) LINK
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Connects drug concentration (PK) to biological effect (PD)

Example workflow:
1. Drug absorption/distribution/elimination (PK model)
   ↓ Predicts C(t)
2. Drug effect on target (PD model)
   ↓ Uses C(t) as input
3. Biomarker/clinical outcome response (disease model)
   ↓ Final observable outcome

This is the core work of clinical pharmacology modeling!


================================================================================
3. MODELING WORKFLOW
================================================================================


STEP 1: PROBLEM DEFINITION
──────────────────────────
Questions to ask:
- What is the biological/clinical question?
- What data do we have? (sample sizes, collection times, biomarkers)
- What are the assumptions? (linear/nonlinear, homogeneous/heterogeneous)
- What is the purpose? (dose justification, simulation, prediction)

STEP 2: MODEL STRUCTURE SELECTION
──────────────────────────────────
Start simple, add complexity as needed:

Simple models:
- One-compartment PK: dC/dt = -k_e*C + (input term)
- Linear PD: E = E_max * C / (EC₅₀ + C)

Intermediate:
- Two-compartment PK: adds peripheral distribution
- Indirect response: models biomarker dynamics

Complex:
- Nonlinear PK: Michaelis-Menten elimination
- Multi-population models: accommodate disease progression
- Stochastic models: incorporate random variability

Selection criteria:
✓ Use simplest model that explains the data
✓ Avoid overfitting (too many parameters for data quality)
✓ Compare models using AIC, BIC, likelihood ratio tests

STEP 3: WRITE THE EQUATIONS
────────────────────────────
Example 1: One-compartment with first-order absorption
  Dose → Absorption compartment → Central compartment → Elimination
  
  dA_abs/dt = -k_a * A_abs
  dC_central/dt = (k_a * A_abs)/V - k_e * C_central
  
  Output: C_central(t) (what we measure)

Example 2: Two-compartment with effect
  dC_c/dt = -(k₁₂ + k_e)*C_c + k₂₁*C_p + (input)/V_c
  dC_p/dt = k₁₂*C_c - k₂₁*C_p
  dE/dt = k_in - k_out*E + (Emax*C_c/(EC50+C_c) - baseline)*f
  
  where C_c = central, C_p = peripheral, E = effect

STEP 4: PARAMETER ESTIMATION (FITTING)
────────────────────────────────────────
Goal: Find parameter values that make predicted data match observed data

Methods:
1. Least Squares (most common)
   Minimize: Σ(observed - predicted)²
   
2. Maximum Likelihood
   Maximize probability of observing data given parameters
   Accounts for measurement error structure
   
3. Weighted Least Squares
   Minimize: Σ w_i*(observed - predicted)²
   Where w_i = 1/variance_i (give more weight to precise measurements)

Optimization algorithms:
- Local: Nelder-Mead, Powell, BFGS (fast, may get stuck in local minimum)
- Global: Differential evolution, genetic algorithms (thorough, slower)

STEP 5: MODEL VALIDATION
─────────────────────────
Tests performed:
1. Goodness-of-fit: R², RMSE, visual inspection
2. Diagnostic plots: residuals should be randomly scattered around zero
3. Parameter uncertainty: confidence intervals, correlation matrices
4. External validation: test on independent data (gold standard)
5. Sensitivity analysis: how much do results change with parameter changes?

Red flags (suggests model issues):
✗ Non-random residual patterns (systematic bias)
✗ Large parameter correlation (multicollinearity)
✗ Unrealistic parameter values (e.g., V = 0.01 L)
✗ Very high standard errors (unstable parameter estimates)
✗ Failed convergence (optimization didn't find solution)

STEP 6: INTERPRETATION & COMMUNICATION
────────────────────────────────────────
Results should answer original questions:
- "What dose do we need?" → Use model to predict dose-response
- "Why does this patient respond differently?" → Population variability
- "What are side effects at this dose?" → PK/PD for safety biomarkers
- "Will drug interact with food/other drugs?" → Simulate altered PK

Communicate to non-modelers:
- Create intuitive visualizations
- Explain uncertainty/confidence intervals
- Focus on clinical implications, not statistics


================================================================================
4. OPTIMIZATION METHODS
================================================================================


LEAST SQUARES FITTING
──────────────────────
Objective: Minimize Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)

SSE = Σ(y_observed[i] - y_predicted[i])²

Python example:
    from scipy.optimize import minimize
    
    def objective(params, t_obs, y_obs):
        y_pred = simulate_model(t_obs, params)
        return np.sum((y_obs - y_pred)**2)
    
    result = minimize(objective, x0=initial_guess, 
                     args=(t_obs, y_obs), method='Nelder-Mead')
    best_params = result.x

WEIGHTED LEAST SQUARES
──────────────────────
When measurements have different precisions:

WSSE = Σ w_i * (y_observed[i] - y_predicted[i])²

Where w_i = 1/σ_i² (inverse variance weighting)

Interpretation: Trust measurements with small variance more

MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION (MLE)
────────────────────────────────────
More principled approach that accounts for measurement error distribution

For normally distributed errors:
    L = Product of [1/(σ*√(2π)) * exp(-(y_obs - y_pred)²/(2σ²))]
    log-likelihood = -N/2*log(2π) - Σlog(σ_i) - Σ(y_obs-y_pred)²/(2σ_i²)

Advantage: Provides natural uncertainty quantification
Disadvantage: More complex, slower to compute

NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES
───────────────────────
Many PK models are nonlinear in parameters:
    y = a*exp(-b*t) + c  ← parameters a,b,c enter nonlinearly

Methods:
- Gauss-Newton: Newton method for nonlinear regression
- Levenberg-Marquardt: adaptive step-size, good for ill-conditioned problems
- Trust-region: robust to poor starting values

Available in scipy.optimize.curve_fit() for simple cases


================================================================================
5. MODEL VALIDATION
================================================================================


GOODNESS-OF-FIT METRICS
───────────────────────

1. R² (Coefficient of Determination)
   R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
   Where SS_res = Σ(y_obs - y_pred)²
         SS_tot = Σ(y_obs - mean(y_obs))²
   
   Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
   Interpretation: proportion of variance explained
   Pitfall: Can be artificially high with more parameters (use adjusted R²)

2. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   RMSE = √(1/n * Σ(y_obs - y_pred)²)
   
   Units: same as y (concentration, count, etc.)
   Use: compare fit quality across models with same data

3. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
   AIC = 2k + n*log(SSE/n)
   Where k = number of parameters, n = number of observations
   
   Use: Model comparison (lower AIC is better)
   Benefit: penalizes complexity

4. BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)
   BIC = k*log(n) + n*log(SSE/n)
   
   Like AIC but stronger penalty for complexity
   Use: Model selection (lower is better)

DIAGNOSTIC PLOTS - WHAT THEY TELL YOU
──────────────────────────────────────

1. OBSERVED vs PREDICTED
   ├─ Good: points scatter around diagonal y=x line
   └─ Bad: systematic deviations (curved pattern, outliers)

2. RESIDUALS vs FITTED
   ├─ Good: random scatter around y=0 line
   ├─ Bad: curved pattern (model bias), funnel shape (heteroscedasticity)
   └─ Action: may need model adjustment or transformation

3. HISTOGRAM of RESIDUALS
   ├─ Good: approximately normal distribution, centered at 0
   ├─ Bad: bimodal, skewed, heavy tails
   └─ Implies: measurement error not normally distributed

4. Q-Q PLOT (Quantile-Quantile)
   ├─ Good: points follow diagonal line
   ├─ Bad: S-shape or departure at extremes
   └─ Tests: normality of residuals

5. SCALE-LOCATION PLOT
   ├─ Good: random scatter, no trend
   ├─ Bad: funnel or curved pattern
   └─ Tests: homoscedasticity (constant variance)

6. RESIDUALS vs ORDER
   ├─ Good: random scatter
   ├─ Bad: cyclic pattern, increasing/decreasing trend
   └─ Tests: independence of measurements

VISUAL PREDICTIVE CHECK (VPC)
──────────────────────────────
Advanced validation for population data:

1. Simulate many subjects from fitted model
2. For each observation time, compute percentiles (5th, 50th, 95th)
3. Compare simulated percentiles to observed percentiles
4. Observed percentiles should fall within simulated range

Success: observed data fall within prediction interval
Failure: systematic bias (try different model structure)

PARAMETER IDENTIFIABILITY
──────────────────────────
Can all parameters be estimated from the data?

Check with:
1. Correlation matrix (high correlations = identification problem)
2. Parameter confidence intervals (infinite = unidentifiable)
3. Profile likelihood plots (flat = poorly identified)

Solutions:
- Fix poorly identified parameters to literature values
- Reduce model complexity
- Collect more/better data (different sampling times)

✓ If limited: emphasize strong foundation in math and quick learning ability

Q: "Tell me about a time you fit a model to data."
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structure your response:
1. Context: "In my [course/project], I had [describe data]"

Q: "What's the difference between population and individual modeling?"
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Answer structure:
- Individual: fit separate parameters to each subject, lots of data per subject
- Population: estimate population mean/variance, often sparse data per subject
- Mixed-effects: compromise, individual deviations from population parameters
- Use NONMEM/Stan/nlmixr for population modeling
- Example: cancer trial, 100 patients with only 3-5 samples each → population approach

Q: "How do you choose between model structures?"
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Say:
1. Start simple (one-compartment)
2. Check fit quality (visual and statistical)
3. If poor fit, increase complexity
4. Use model comparison: AIC, BIC, likelihood ratio test
5. Confirm biological plausibility
6. Validate on independent data if possible

Q: "What would you do if your model doesn't fit well?"
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Troubleshooting approach:
1. Visual inspection: where's the model failing? (early, late, high, low concentrations)
2. Diagnostic plots: is it a systematic problem?
3. Check data quality: outliers, missing values, measurement errors?
4. Consider model modifications:
   - Add/change compartments
   - Try nonlinear kinetics
   - Account for time-varying parameters
   - Consider disease-state or covariate effects
5. Incorporate prior knowledge: fix some parameters to literature values
6. Increase parameter estimation iterations/methods

Q: "How do you handle parameter uncertainty?"
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Methods:
1. Confidence intervals: standard errors from optimization Hessian matrix
2. Bootstrap: resample data, refit model, examine parameter distribution
3. Bayesian credible intervals: MCMC methods (pymc3, Stan)
4. Profiling: scan each parameter while optimizing others
5. Sensitivity analysis: simulation with perturbed parameters

Interpretation: quantify how much estimates change with data perturbations

Q: "What experience do you have with [tool: NONMEM/mrgsolve/nlmixr/stan/etc]?"
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Honest answer preferred. Options:
- If you know it: "I've used [tool] for [application] and found [advantage]"

  with [alternative] and I'm quick to learn new tools. Here's how I approach 
  learning: [mention methodology]"

Tools used in industry:
- NONMEM: gold standard for population PK, but expensive, steep learning curve
- R packages: nlmixr (free), mrgsolve (simulation)

optimize doses and predict drug-drug interactions. I'm particularly 
interested in your work in [research area]."

Q: "What are your strengths and weaknesses?"
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Strengths:
- Quantitative (specific: "strong at differential equations" not "math skills")
- Problem-solving (give example)
- Programming (mention languages)
- Attention to detail in validation
- Communication of technical results

- "I sometimes over-focus on perfect solutions; I'm learning to iterate"
- "I haven't done population PK before, but I understand the principles"

Q: "What questions do you have for us?"
────────────────────────────────────────
Good questions show you did research:
- "What therapeutic areas does your team focus on?"
- "What are the biggest challenges in your current projects?"
- "How does your team use modeling to influence clinical decisions?"

TALKING POINTS FOR INTERVIEW:

When showing/discussing these examples:

"I created this to understand ODE fitting for clinical pharmacology. 
It demonstrates:

1. Mathematical modeling: I formulated compartmental models based on 
   first-principles pharmacological principles
   
2. Practical implementation: I used Python's scipy.integrate for ODE 
   solving and scipy.optimize for parameter fitting
